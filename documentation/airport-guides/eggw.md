### About the London Terminal Manoeuvring Area
The London TMA is the airspace surrounding much of London's main airports of Heathrow, Stansted, Luton, City and Southend. The London TMA is operated by NATS, the main Air Navigation Service Provider in the UK. The area is controlled from Swanwick; a small town located near Nottingham in the North of England.

The LTMA is part of the London Terminal Control Centre, which handles traffic below FL245 flying to and from any of London's airports.

### Statistics

### Primary Airport :: London Luton Airport
London Luton Airport is an international airport 29 miles north of Central London and 1.7 miles east of Luton. London Luton is where easyJet, a large no-frills budget airline, started its operations in the 90s with two domestic routes to Edinburgh and Glasgow. The airport has seen various expansions since, however it retains the original, single two-storey terminal building which has 62 check-in desks. In February 2017, Hungarian low-cost carrier Wizz Air opened a British base at Luton, initially flying to Tel Aviv, Pristina and Kutaisi and its other bases. 

### Airspace

### Standard Operating Procedures
##### Continuous Descent Approaches
Any aircraft which has a Maximum Takeoff Mass exceeding 5700kg should apply CDA procedures to all approaches. These approaches should commence from 5000ft.

##### Speed Restrictions
250kt IAS should be maintained under FL100.

The following speed restrictions should be enforced:
* 220kt during intermediate approach phase;
* 180kt on base leg, or heading towards the ILS;
* 180 - 160kt when established on the ILS;
* 160 - 170kt until 5DME.

##### Arrivals
When the Barkway (BKY) VOR is inoperable, CASEY STARs should be used instead of ABBOT STARs.

CTAs and ATZs of all the major airports are displayed too.

Every dash on an extended centreline represents one (1) nautical mile, with each small 'T' representing four (4) miles.
All sector splits of the LTMA are drawn on too.
